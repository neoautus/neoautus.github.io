        <description>&lt;p&gt;A Neoautus resulta da união de esforços e investimentos de três empresários experientes na área da tecnologia, que têm em comum o objetivo muito ambicioso de utilizar a tecnologia para alavancar a educação em geral, a cognição, o esclarecimento, a participação, a criação e aplicação de conhecimento em larga escala.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“Soon we will have or need a far more complex system than the current financial system to balance inter-relations, business, trading in the value adding cycle of creation, aquisition of data, information refinary and knowledge development in this new era.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;big-data---analytics-das-coisas&quot;&gt;Big Data - &lt;em&gt;Analytics&lt;/em&gt; das Coisas&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We consider the information era is actually starting now with Big Data and IOT, the planet is never going to be the same, life is going to be even more impacted or chagned by this technology era than we have seen so far with Internet and Communications era. We need to reflect, though. upon issues like data property, privacy and clear rules of exchange. Soon we will have or need a far more complex system than the current financial system to balance inter-relations, business, trading in the value adding cycle of creation, aquisition of data, information refinary and knowledge development in this new era.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Technological resources abundance&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Data Science and Dominium specialists&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Value adding from Specialist Analysis&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&quot;internet-of-things&quot;&gt;Internet of Things&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Things will play a definite part on the tracking, acquiring, monitoring, controlling data in this era, the abundance of technical resources, specially on the peer side will contribute to enhance the resolution of data gathering to a point where the understansing of reality will break some otherwise impenetrable barriers of understanding the universe, physically, human beings behaviorally, nature, biologically, chemistry dinamically, and so forth to a point that knowledge will impact our ways of being and coping with the universe. Some call this effort IOE (Internet of Everything), since everything might be used to scan, monitor and deepen the understanding of the universe surrounding us, creating knowledge to cope with nature far beyond the current 5 senses of perception.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;Neoautus is a joint effort and investiment from three accomplished technology enterpreneurs, that have a common and very ambitious objective to use techonology to leverage general education, cognition, clarification, participation, knowledge creation and application in large scale.&lt;/p&gt;
